    "ACRONYMS AND ABBREVIATIONS": "A. General rule  1. At first-and even only-mention, always spell out a term in full and enclose in parentheses its acronym or abbreviation, if any.   2. In succeeding mentions, only use the acronym or abbreviation.  3. To avoid filling a paragraph with the same acronym (e.g., BSP),  try to use descriptive words-such as 'Bank,' 'central bank,' or 'monetary authority'-or the shortened 'Bangko Sentral' in subsequent mentions.  4. As much as possible, avoid using acronyms when referring to  the Philippines in any material. Instead, spell out 'the Philippines' in full or use 'the country' for variation.  B. Titles and name suffixes  1. Titles must be abbreviated, followed by a period, if used before a name. Otherwise, they must be spelled out.  Examples:  - Rep. Juan V. dela Cruz came from the second biggest congressional district.  - The representative from the second biggest congressional district sponsored a bill on unemployment insurance.  2. Spell out 'Governor' when referring to the head of the BSP, regardless if it precedes a name or not.  Examples:  - BSP Governor Juan V. dela Cruz said...   - The Governor explained...  3. For name suffixes, place the abbreviated form after the last name, separated by a comma.  Examples:  - Juan V. dela Cruz, Jr. - Juan V. dela Cruz, Sr.   \n \n4. Professional titles (Dr., Atty., Engr.), academic degrees or licenses (PhD, CPA, CMA), and honorifics (Mr., Ms., Mrs.) may be used in BSP publications, if applicable.  C. Time   1. When indicating the time, use the lowercase acronyms for meridian indicators, with periods after each letter.  Examples:  - The flag-raising ceremony began at 9:05 a.m.  - The flag-lowering ceremony will be held at 5:10 p.m.  2. Avoid using meridian indicators with phrases like 'in the morning' or 'in the afternoon,' as it is redundant.  Example:  \n The meeting will start at 8:00 a.m. \n The meeting will start at 8:00 in the morning. \n The meeting will start at 8:00 a.m. in the morning.  D. Time periods  1. In abbreviating time periods, the BSP convention is 'QN YYYY' when referring to quarters and 'HN YYYY' when referring to semesters of the year.   Examples:  - Residential real estate prices for new housing units maintain their growth momentum in Q3 2022.   - The net income after tax of the non-stock savings and loans association industry went up in H1 2022.   2. For speeches, time periods are spelled out in full to ensure clarity and maintain a formal tone.  Examples:  - The number of basic deposit accounts rose to 22.9 million in the second quarter of 2023.  - The Philippines continued to be one of the fastest-growing economies in Southeast Asia in the first quarter of 2024.    \n \nE. Addresses  1. Streets, avenues, and boulevards are abbreviated in a numbered address. Otherwise, they must be spelled out.  Examples:  - The park is located at 4415 A. Mabini St.  - The BSP Head Office is situated along P. Ocampo Street.  2. In abbreviating countries, the current BSP style is to not add any periods (e.g., UK, US) for brevity.     For the term 'foreign exchange,' use the acronym (FX) for reports and the abbreviation (forex) for speeches.    F. Laws  1. In abbreviating Philippine legislation and executive issuances, BSP materials must follow the conventions below:  TYPE OF LEGISLATION  OR ISSUANCE ACRONYM Republic Act RA Presidential Decree PD Administrative Order AO Executive Order EO House Bill HB Senate Bill SB  Example:  - Republic Act No. 7653 is abbreviated as RA No. 7653   2. When citing a law from a series of legislation, use the phrase  'series of YYYY' at first mention and its abbreviated form 's. YYYY' in subsequent references.  Example:   - Presidential Decree No. 1771, series of 1981, is abbreviated as  PD No. 1771, s. 1981  \n \n3. For issuances from the Monetary Board, spell out 'Monetary Board Resolution' at first mention. Use 'MB Resolution' or simply 'Resolution' (capitalized if followed by a number) in subsequent references.  G. Other rules  1. Treat titles, headings, and subheadings as independent from the body. Always spell out terms in full and repeat them when first mentioned in the main text before assigning an acronym. This rule extends to subject lines in letters and memoranda, and titles of figures and tables.   2. For lengthy publications, the recommendation is to create a dedicated page listing all acronyms and abbreviations used in the document for easy reference.  3. Take note of the combined use of uppercase and lowercase letters in acronyms and abbreviations of commonly used terms in the BSP. Common nouns are always written in lowercase.1   \n",
    "CAPITALIZATION": "A. General rule  1. Avoid unnecessary capitalization. Use capital letters only for proper nouns, proper names, popular places (e.g., Baywalk) and events (e.g., People Power Revolution), derivatives of proper nouns  (e.g., Christian, Islamic, Filipino), typhoon names, intellectual or artistic compositions, titles when used before a name, and months.  2. Capitalize names of regions, such as Asia, Africa, North America, Central America, and Europe. However, 'eurozone' and 'euro area' (the currency area) and 'euro' (the currency itself) should be written in lowercase.  B. Organizational units  1. The first letter of each word in 'Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' is always capitalized.  2. The first letter of each word in 'Central Bank of the Philippines' is also always capitalized when referring to the institution that existed from 1949 until June 1993 as the predecessor of the BSP. Otherwise, the generic term 'central bank' should be written in lowercase.  3. Always check the usage of common nouns. If a common noun is used as an alternate for a particular person or institution, its first letter should be capitalized.   Examples:  - the Bank in reference to the BSP  - the Governor in reference to the BSP Governor  - the Board in reference to the BSP's Monetary Board  - the Fund in reference to the International Monetary Fund  - the Committee in reference to the Development Budget Coordination Committee  4. Capitalize and hyphenate 'Sub-Sector' when referring to a specific BSP unit (e.g., Monetary Policy Sub-Sector). For subsequent references, use the acronym (e.g., MPSS) or write 'the Sub-Sector.' However, 'subsector,' when used as an independent term, should be written in lowercase and without a hyphen.  5. Capitalize 'Office' and 'Branch' when referring to a specific BSP unit (e.g., BSP North Luzon Regional Office, BSP Lucena Branch). However, 'regional offices and branches,' referring to multiple BSP units, should be written in lowercase.  \n \n6. Capitalize the first letter of each word in 'Head Office' when referring to the BSP headquarters in Manila and in 'Security Plant Complex' when referring to the BSP's currency production and distribution unit.   7. Capitalize the first letter of each word in the official names of government offices (except prepositions, conjunctions, and articles). However, the first letter of each word in descriptive terms for government offices are written in lowercase.  Examples:  - Department of Finance  - the finance department  - Department of Budget and Management - the budget and management department  - Bureau of the Treasury - the treasury bureau  C. Official designations  1. Titles of BSP officials are only capitalized when used before a person's name. They are written in lowercase if used as a descriptive term or as a standalone word.  Examples:  - Monetary Board Member Juan V. dela Cruz - Juan V. dela Cruz, a Monetary Board member  - Deputy Governor Juan V. dela Cruz - Juan V. dela Cruz, the deputy governor of the Monetary and Economics Sector  - Director Juan V. dela Cruz - Juan V. dela Cruz, the director of the Department of Economic Research  2. The first letter of each word in the term 'Monetary Board' is always capitalized when used in reference to the governing body of  the BSP. 'Board' is also capitalized in subsequent mentions. However, 'monetary board' and 'monetary authority' should be written in lowercase when referring to the monetary policy bodies of central banks in general.  3. Similar to the 'Governor' of the BSP, the first letter of the word 'President' is always capitalized when referring to a specific president of a country.  \n \nExamples:  - President Juan V. dela Cruz - Juan V. dela Cruz, the Philippine President  - The President said that...   4. In titles of government positions, the first letter of each word is capitalized only if the title comes before a person's name.  Otherwise, lowercase is used.  Examples:   - Finance Secretary Juan V. dela Cruz - Juan V. dela Cruz, the finance secretary  - Customs Commissioner Juan V. dela Cruz - Juan V. dela Cruz, the customs commissioner   5. For hyphenated titles, capitalize the first letter of each element (except prepositions) when used before a name. Otherwise, use the lowercase.   Examples:  \n Officer-in-Charge Juan V. dela Cruz \n Officer-In-Charge Juan V. dela Cruz \n Officer-in-charge Juan V. dela Cruz  \n Co-Chair Juan V. dela Cruz \n Co-chair Juan V. dela Cruz  D. Titles and subtitles   1. Titles of works are written in title case, where the first letter of each word is capitalized, except articles (a, an, the), conjunctions  (or, and, but, etc.), and prepositions (on, for, into, among, etc.).2   Examples:  \n Keeping the Inflation Target Unchanged for 2022-2024  \n Keeping The Inflation Target Unchanged For 2022-2024  \n Keeping the inflation target unchanged for 2022-2024   \n Safeguarding Price Stability amid Challenging Times \n Safeguarding Price Stability Amid Challenging Times \n Safeguarding price stability amid challenging times    2 This rule departs from the APA Publication Manual, which suggests capitalizing prepositions with four or more letters (e.g., with, until, beyond, through).  CAPITALIZATION \n \n2. In cases where the title begins with an article, a conjunction, or a preposition, the first word must be capitalized.  Examples:  \n The Economics of Tomorrow \n the Economics of Tomorrow \n The economics of tomorrow  \n On the Creation of an Overnight Rate \n on the Creation of an Overnight Rate \n On the creation of an overnight rate  3. Subtitles are also written in title case. The first letter of the subtitle's first word (the word immediately following the colon) is always capitalized, regardless if it is a conjunction, a preposition, or an article.  Examples:  \n Creating Impactful Changes: Priorities for the Next Six Years \n Creating Impactful Changes: priorities for the next six years \n Creating impactful changes: Priorities for the next six years  \n Forging a Sustainable Future: Beyond Economic Growth \n Forging a Sustainable Future: beyond Economic Growth \n Forging a sustainable future: Beyond economic growth  4. On the contrary, titles of attributed works listed in the references are always written in sentence case. Only the first letter of the first word of the title and subtitle, as well as proper nouns are capitalized.  Examples:  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. (2021). Rebuilding from the pandemic: Getting back on track. Retrieved 3 February 2023,  from www.bsp.gov.ph  Castañares, S. J. (2022). Keeping the inflation target unchanged for 2022-2024 [Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Economic Newsletter No. 22-01]. Manila, Philippines.     For detailed guidance on the proper formatting for references, refer to Section VIII (pp. 39-47).      \n \nE. Content headings and subheadings  1. All headings (chapter titles) and subheadings are written in sentence case, except for proper nouns, which are always capitalized.    Example:   [Heading]  Advocacies, initiatives, and financial results         [Subhead]  Consumer protection                 [Sub-subhead]  Complaints data management                [Sub-subhead]  Market conduct policymaking                 [Sub-subhead]  Consumer Complaints Resolution Office          [Subhead]  Organizational capability                [Sub-subhead]  Training and technical assistance projects                [Sub-subhead]  Monetary Board operations management                [Sub-subhead]  Comptrollership management  2. This rule extends to headlines of reports and press releases.  F. Other rules  1. Technical, economic, and other general terminologies that are common nouns should not be capitalized, even if they are accompanied by acronyms or abbreviations.    Examples:  - gross domestic product - capital adequacy ratio - advanced economy - agriculture, fishery, and forestry - memorandum of agreement - implementing rules and regulations - business process outsourcing - automated teller machine - universal and commercial banks - national government  - government-owned and -controlled corporation - local government unit  2. The capitalization of past economic crises varies depending on  the context. Capitalization is used when referring to official names. Otherwise, use the lowercase.     \n10 Examples:  - Asian Financial Crisis of 1998  - Asian3 financial crisis in 1998  - Global Financial Crisis of 2020 - global financial crisis in 2020  3. The first letter of the name of a typhoon (either international or local) and the word/s preceding it are always capitalized.  Examples:  - Typhoon Odette (international name 'Rai') - Tropical Storm Ondoy (international name 'Ketsana') - Super Typhoon Yolanda (international name 'Haiyan')  4. Write the spelled-out 'coronavirus disease 2019' and its variants  (e.g., omicron variant) in lowercase. Meanwhile, write the acronym 'COVID-19' in uppercase.   Examples:  - The timely imposition of quarantine restrictions helped control the surge in coronavirus disease 2019 cases.   - Favorable consumer sentiments emerged as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted.  - The decisive action of the national government helped arrest the spread of the more transmissible omicron variant.    3 The term 'Asian' is a derivative of 'Asia,' which is a proper noun, hence the retained capitalization. CAPITALIZATION",
    "NUMBERS": "A. General rule  1. Spell out numbers 'zero' to 'nine,' and use figures for numbers 10 and above.   Exception: Always spell out numbers in the following cases:  - at the start of a sentence Eleven countries participated in the economic summit.  - in indefinite and casual uses The proposal outlined potential cost savings, with figures reaching over a hundred million pesos.  - in fanciful usage The old central bank building seemed to hold a thousand stories within its walls.  - in formal language, rhetorical quotations, and figures of speech His charismatic speech was a masterclass in persuasion, leaving the audience feeling like a billion dollars.   - in fractions less than one that are not used as modifiers The profit margin improved by two-fifths over the last quarter.  Exception: Always use figures in headlines, tables, statistics, sequences, and in cases where the number represents the following:   - age 7 years old  - addresses 8 J.V. Brion St.  - court decisions G.R. No. 242518   - course numbers Economics 101  - time intervals 1 day and 2 hours  - dimensions 10 cm x 5 cm  - distances 5 kilometers - equations 3 + 4 = 7  - millions, billions, trillions 1.5 million  - monetary units ₱10  - odds and ratios 3:4  - ranking 1st place  - sequential designations  Section 4  - temperatures 32°C\n \n2. When starting a sentence with a year, precede the figure with the phrase 'the year.'  Example:  \n The year 2011 recorded a pickup in imports. \n 2011 recorded a pickup in imports.  3. When starting a sentence with a decimal, precede the figure with an article (a, an, the).  Example:   \n A 12.2-percent increase was recorded in the employment rate. \n 12.2 percent is the recorded increase in the employment rate.  An alternative to the example above would be to rewrite it as:  \n The employment rate increased by 12.2 percent.  4. When citing applicable reglementary and legal periods, follow the formatting convention from the Philippines' Rules of Court, which combines spelled-out numbers and figures (enclosed in parentheses).4  Examples:  - two (2) business days - fifteen (15) calendar days  B. Decimals   1. As the BSP handles various kinds of data, there is no standard rule regarding the number of decimal places to use. However, it is crucial to select an appropriate number of decimal places that fits the context and apply it consistently throughout the document or publication.  Exception: When writing speeches and social media content, always round up numbers to one decimal place for brevity.  2. For numbers that are less than one, use a leading zero before the decimal point.  Examples:  - The 2022 inflation forecast is lower by 0.2 percentage points. - Government expenditures grew by 0.6 percent in 2023.  4 Source: https://www.set.gov.ph/resources/revised-rules-of-court/1997-rules-of-civil-procedure  \n \nException: For statistics that cannot exceed one (i.e., correlations, proportions, levels of statistical significance), omit the zero before the decimal point. This omission serves as a visual indicator that the value is restricted and can never exceed one.  Examples:  - r(24) = -.43 - p = .028  3. For percentages that are whole numbers and are less than 10, add '.0' to maintain their numeric format instead of spelling them out.   Example:  \n 9.0 percent \n 9 percent \n nine percent  4. For percentages that are whole numbers and are 10 and above, add '.0' when used in relation/comparison to decimal numbers.   Examples:   - The capital adequacy ratio of universal banks remained above the international standard of 8.0 percent and the BSP's regulatory threshold of 10.0 percent.  - Gross capital formation sustained its growth momentum at 13.8 percent in 2022 from 20.0 percent in 2021.  C. Large numbers  1. Numbers above 999 should be written with a comma (e.g., 1,000; 10,000; 100,000).    Exception: Avoid using commas for large numbers that represent the following:  - denominations 1000-piso    - addresses  72518 Aurora Blvd.   - radio frequencies  1460 kilohertz   - serial numbers BSP850129  - years 1998  - telephone numbers (+632) 8811-1277 2. Large numbers such as '1,000,000' may be written as '1 million,' '10,000 million' as '10 billion,' '10,000 billion' as '10 trillion,' and so on.  \n \nInstead of lengthy numerical series, convert complex data into tables and graphs. This enhances readability and makes information more digestible for the reader.    D. Roman numerals   1. Use Roman numerals (I, II, III) instead of Arabic (1, 2, 3) when referring to the regions of the Philippines.    Examples:  - Region IV-A (CALABARZON) - Region IX (Zamboanga Peninsula)  2. Use Roman numerals to indicate the volume of a series of materials.  Examples:  - The Governors Speak, Volume II - 2023 BSP Annual Report, Volume III  E. Number ranges and series  1. For ranges of monetary values, adopt the AP Stylebook convention of repeating the unit of measure.5  Examples:  \n from US$0.95 up to US$10.00  \n US$0.95 up to 10  \n ₱12 million to ₱14 million  \n ₱12 to 14 million  2. For age ranges, write 'XX to XX' or 'XX-XX,' followed by the phrase 'years of age' or 'years old.'   Examples:  \n 18-25 years old \n 18 years-25 years old   \n 9 to 12 years of age \n 9 years to 12 years of age    5 Source: APA Publication Manual, 7th edition NUMBERS \n\n3. For percentage ranges, avoid repeating the unit of measure.  Examples:  \n 2.0-4.0 percent  \n 2.0 percent-4.0 percent  \n 0.4 to 0.7 percentage point \n 0.4 percentage point (ppt) to 0.7 ppt  4. For year ranges pertaining to the duration of strategic plans,  use the midsized dash (-) instead of the preposition 'to'  (i.e., XXXX-XXXX).   Examples:  \n Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028  \n Philippine Development Plan 2023 to 2028   \n Information Systems Strategic Plan 2020-2023 \n Information Systems Strategic Plan 2020 to 2023  5. For debt papers, repeat the terms when mentioned in a sequence.  Example:  \n 10-day, 14-day, and 28-day tenors  \n 10-, 14-, and 28-day tenors  F. Fractions  1. The AP Stylebook recommends spelling out fractions less than one, with hyphens between the words.   Examples:  \n one-half \n ½  \n three-fourths \n ¾  2. For values greater than one, use figures in decimal form.  Examples:  \n 2.4 \n 12/5  \n twelve-fifths  \n 1.75 \n 7/4 \n seven-fourths\n \nG. Ordinal numbers   1. In writing ordinal numbers, follow the general rule of spelling out 'zero' to 'nine' and using figures for 10 and above.  Examples:  - The Governor delivered his fourth speech this morning. - This is the 13th meeting of the Governor for the week.  Exception: Use figures for all ordinal numbers, including nine and below, when referring to a series of events like conferences, roundtable discussions, and annual meetings.  Examples:  - 2nd Annual Meeting of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion - 9th National Convention of the Philippine Economic Society     Ordinal indicators (i.e., -st, -nd, -rd, -th) that follow a numeral should always be in superscript.    H. Number agreement  1. Percent  A phrase with 'percent' (also majority, most, bulk, etc.) takes the singular verb when standing alone.  Examples:  - The survey indicated that 65 percent was allocated to savings. - Majority believes that the policy will boost the economy.  The phrase also takes the singular verb when it is followed by a singular noun.   Example:  - Over 50 percent of the membership was present.  Conversely, the phrase takes the plural verb when it is followed by a plural noun.  Example:  - Over 50 percent of the members were present. \n \n2. Numbers less than one  Numbers less than one are treated as singular in most instances.  Examples:  - Based on projections, 0.5 basis point is the expected decrease in interest rates.   - According to the latest report, 0.8 percentage point was the estimated decline in manufacturing last year.  3. None  'None' usually means 'no single one.' When used in this sense,  it always takes the singular verb.  Examples:  - None of the investments was profitable.  - None of the estimates was accurate.  When 'none' is used with mass nouns (or things that cannot be counted), it is also treated as singular.   Examples:  - None of the capital was utilized. - None of the information was relevant.  Use a plural verb with 'none' only if it was used to mean 'no two' or 'no amount of these things.'  Examples:  - None of the analysts agree on the market forecast. - None of the strategies align with our goals.  4. Zero   'Zero' takes the plural form with countable nouns, while it takes the singular form with mass nouns.  Examples:  - The bank reported zero profits for the quarter. - The project received zero funding.\n \n5. Fractions  For phrases indicating portions, determine the verb agreement by looking at the prepositional phrase. Use a singular verb if the object of the preposition is singular and a plural verb if the object is plural.   Examples:  - One-third of the population is unemployed. - One-third of the people are unemployed.  6. Time intervals   Time intervals referring to a single period take the singular verb, while those referring to multiple instances take the plural verb.  Examples:  - One hour is sufficient for the meeting. - Several days have passed since the release of the forecast.  Exception: In some cases, consider the context and the noun that follows the time interval to determine whether to use a singular or plural verb.   Examples6:  - Two weeks is a long time to wait. - Five hours is the maximum duration for this meeting. - Six months is the standard probationary period for new employees.   6 In the examples, the emphasis is on the concept of time (which is singular) rather than on the specific durations, hence the use of singular verbs.",
    "PUNCTUATION": "A. Period  1. Periods are commonly used to signal the end of sentences and are also used in many abbreviations (e.g., a.m., Cong., Rep., Sen.).   2. When used to end sentences or abbreviations of titles, a space should follow the period (e.g., Dr. Jones, Rep. Smith).  3. Avoid using periods for phrases that express incomplete thoughts. Periods should only apply to complete sentences, where a subject and a verb are present.  B. Comma  1. Use of serial comma  The APA Publication Manual recommends using commas to separate elements in a series of three or more items, including before the last item, called the serial or Oxford comma.  Examples:  - The BSP provides policy direction in the areas of money, banking, and credit.  - We intend to help the financial system remain safe, sound, and resilient.  2. Use of comma after an introductory phrase  An introductory phrase is a group of words that precedes a sentence and provides context for the main idea. A comma is used after an introductory phrase to clarify the sentence structure.  Examples:  - With technological advancements, productivity gains were observed in manufacturing.  - In 2023, the financial system provided broad-based support for the economy.  3. Use of comma for a nonessential clause   A nonessential or nonrestrictive clause is a group of words that provides additional information but is not essential to the meaning of the sentence. Commas are used to set off these clauses.   \n \nExamples:  - The trade agreement, implemented last year, finally boosted exports for local manufacturers.  - The project, funded by the central bank, aims to promote sustainable development.  4. Use of comma for two independent clauses  Coordinating conjunctions (and, but, so, yet, etc.) connect two independent clauses. A comma is placed before these conjunctions to delineate the relationship between the clauses.   Example:  - Banks expanded their lending operations, so small businesses had easier access to capital.  Exception: Omit the comma when one of the clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction is a dependent clause.  Example:  \n Banks expanded their lending operations and reached small businesses.  \n Banks expanded their lending operations, and reached small businesses.  An alternative to the example above would be to rewrite it as:  \n Banks expanded their lending operations, and they reached small businesses.  5. Omission of comma before ‘because'  'Because' is a subordinating conjunction used to introduce a clause of purpose, connecting a subordinate clause to an independent clause. There should be no comma between the two clauses joined by 'because.'  Examples:  - Our domestic growth exceeded expectations because the export sector experienced a surge in demand from overseas markets.  - The unemployment rate dropped significantly because several large companies invested heavily in new production facilities. \n \nC. Semicolon  1. Use of semicolon for two independent clauses  Use a semicolon to join two independent clauses that share a logical connection but are not linked by a coordinating conjunction.  Examples:  - Stock markets experienced volatility; investors sought safer assets.  - The bank maintained a stable position in the market;  its prudent investment strategies proved effective.  2. Use of semicolon with conjunctive adverbs and transitional expressions  Use a semicolon to replace a period between related sentences when the second sentence starts with either a conjunctive adverb (however, therefore, meanwhile, otherwise, then, nonetheless, etc.) or a transitional expression (for instance, that is, as a result, etc.).  Examples:  - New tax policies were implemented; nonetheless, economic growth remained robust.  - Unemployment rates decreased significantly; as a result,  the economy experienced steady growth throughout the year.  3. Use of semicolon in a serial list   Use semicolons to separate list items that contain internal punctuation.  Example:  - The program was launched in San Pablo City, Laguna;  Lipa City, Batangas; and Lucena City, Quezon last year.   4. Use of semicolon for multiple parenthetical citations  Use semicolons to separate multiple parenthetical citations within parentheses.  Example:  - Several studies have examined the impact of climate change on the economy (Brown, 2019; Lee, 2020;  Ross et al., 2018).  PUNCTUATION \n \nD. Colon  1. Use a colon after a grammatically complete introductory clause.  If the clause following the colon is also a complete sentence, capitalize the first word.   Examples:  - Central banking has three pillars: price stability, financial stability, and an efficient payments and settlements system.  - The report reaffirmed earlier findings: Consumer spending greatly influences market trends.  2. Avoid placing a colon after an introductory clause that is not a complete sentence.  Examples:   - The three pillars of central banking are price stability, financial stability, and an efficient payments and settlements system.  - The report reaffirmed that consumer spending greatly influences market trends.  Exception: Titles with subtitles, typically separated by a colon, are not subject to the said rules.  Examples:   - A Future-Ready Philippines: Digital, Sustainable, Inclusive - The Halftime Report: The BSP's Pursuit of Price Stability  E. Hyphen  1. Use of hyphen for compound words  The AP Stylebook and the APA Publication Manual have broadly similar recommendations on the use of hyphens as joiners for compound words or modifiers. The general rule is to hyphenate two-word terms to avoid confusion and unintended meanings.  Example:  \n He is a small-business owner.  (He owns a small business.)  \n He is a small business owner. (The business owner is small.)  \n \nException: Some two-word terms have become commonly recognized as single words to the extent that hyphens are no longer necessary.  Examples:  - climate change report - real estate transaction - emergency room visit - parking lot entrance  For generic terms preceded by the word 'electronic,' use the hyphenated 'e-' (e.g., e-commerce). However, for 'electronic mail,' the convention has shifted from 'e-mail' (abbreviated and hyphenated) to 'email' (one word).     For guidance on which compound words require the use of hyphens, refer to Webster's New World College Dictionary.    2. Use of hyphen for numbers acting as modifiers  The APA Publication Manual recommends using hyphens in compound words where the first element is a number.  Examples:   - six-trial problem - 10-point scale - 16-minute interval - 25-page document  While they did not provide an example involving percentages,  a '100-percent increase' aligns with this guidance. Thus, it is recommended to add a hyphen between the number and the word 'percent' when it is used as a modifier before an increase/decrease, a growth/decline, or a percentage change.  Examples:  - Exports of electronic products reversed from an 8.6-percent growth in 2022 to a 9.7-percent contraction in 2023.  - Secondary income net receipts registered a 3.5-percent expansion from US$29.5 billion in 2021.     \n \n3. Use of hyphen for words acting as modifiers  Certain terms can function either as verb phrases (unhyphenated) or compound adjectives (hyphenated), with the proper usage determined by their grammatical role in a sentence.  VERB PHRASE COMPOUND ADJECTIVE It took a high risk to do the operation. The high-risk operation went well. They prefer to work from home. They had a work-from-home policy. I will pick up the package tomorrow. They have a pick-up service available. We had to check in at the front desk. The check-in process was quick. You need to follow up on that report. We received a follow-up email. It is important to meet face to face. We had a face-to-face discussion.  4. Use of hyphen for prefixes and suffixes  Hyphens are required for certain words with prefixes and suffixes to prevent misinterpretation.  HYPHENATED UNHYPHENATED re-pair (to pair again) repair (to fix) re-form (to form again) reform (system improvement) re-cover (to cover again) recover (to regain) re-sign (to sign again) resign (to quit) re-mark (to mark again) remark (comment) un-ionized (not ionized) unionized (united workforce)  Exception: Some words with prefixes and suffixes are better written as single words.  Examples:  - underdeveloped - interagency - microeconomics - socioeconomic - posttest - interbank - nonprofit - cybersecurity - microfinance - midpoint         \n \nF. Dashes  1. Use of em dash (-)  Use the em dash or long dash (whose length is roughly equal to the width of the letter 'M') to indicate an abrupt change, to set off a series within a phrase, or to start a list. There should be no space before and after an em dash.   Examples:  - The forecast for the upcoming quarter-marked by increased consumer spending and a surge in manufacturing activity-suggests a positive trajectory for overall market growth.  - The factors influencing economic growth-technological innovation, government policies, and global trade dynamics-are complex and interconnected.  2. Use of en dash (-)  Use the en dash or midsized dash (whose length is roughly equal to the width of the letter 'N'), instead of the hyphen, for number and date ranges. There should be no space before and after an en dash.  Examples:  - The growth target of the national government for 2022 was 6.5-7.5 percent.  - Several year-end ceremonies were held in the facility from 19-24 December 2024.     To insert dashes in a document, navigate to the 'Insert' tab on the ribbon, select 'Advanced symbol,' and choose 'Special characters.'    G. Parentheses  1. Use parentheses to set off structurally independent elements.  Example:  - Professional forecasters' inflation expectations closely correlate with actual monthly inflation (Figure 2).   \n \n2. Use parentheses to set off letters that identify items in a list within a sentence.  Example:  - The factors considered in the analysis were (a) market demand trends, (b) production costs, and (c) government policy impacts on import tariffs.  3. Use parentheses to introduce an acronym or abbreviation.   Example:  - The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a political and economic union of 10 states in Southeast Asia.   H. Square brackets  1. Use square brackets to enclose parenthetical material that is already within parentheses.  Example:  - The bank accepts payments through various channels  (e.g., over-the-counter, payment gateway [debit or credit card], online banking).  2. Use square brackets to enclose additional information inserted into a quotation by someone other than the original author.  Example:   - He said, 'The policy reforms [proposed by the government] aim to stimulate economic growth amid global trade uncertainties.'  I. Apostrophe  1. Use an apostrophe and 's' ('s) to indicate possession for singular nouns (e.g., the BSP's art collection).  2. Use an apostrophe and 's' ('s) to indicate possession for singular nouns ending in 's' (e.g., James's book).  3. Use an apostrophe after the 's' to indicate possession for plural nouns ending in 's' (e.g., employees' benefits).  4. Use an apostrophe and 's' ('s) to indicate possession for irregular plural nouns not ending in 's' (e.g., men's uniform).  \n \n5. When indicating possession for acronyms or abbreviations following spelled-out terms, place the apostrophe and 's' ('s) after the closing parenthesis.  Example:  \n The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)'s policy rate \n The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' (BSP) policy rate \n The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas's (BSP) policy rate  Alternatively, consider rewriting the sentence using an 'of' phrase.  \n The policy rate of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)  J. Quotation marks  1. Quotation marks are used to indicate the exact words of a source.   2. Quotation marks may also be used to signify composition titles, nicknames, unfamiliar terms, and irony.    3. When quoting within a quote, alternate between double quotation marks (' , ') and single quotation marks (‘ , ').  Example:  - She said, 'I agree with his statement, ‘Economic policies impact social welfare,' yet there are other significant factors to consider.'  4. Use three quotation marks together if two quoted elements end at the same time.  Example:  - He said, 'According to the article, ‘Consumer behavior greatly influences pricing strategies in the Philippines.''  5. The use of single and double quotation marks also varies to facilitate ease of reading. Single quotation marks are used for quotes in titles, while double quotation marks are used for quotes in the body (main text).  Example:   [Title]  From ‘Nowhere' to ‘Now Here': Transforming    Economic Challenges into Opportunities   [Body]  I am very optimistic that 'nowhere' will become 'now    here.' With the help of all our partners, I have no    reason to think otherwise. \n \n6. Punctuating around quotation marks7  PUNCTUATION PLACEMENT periods and commas inside quotation marks other punctuation marks outside quotation marks parentheses outside quotation marks question marks or exclamation points that are part of the quoted material inside quotation marks question marks or exclamation points that are not part of the quoted material outside quotation marks  K. Ellipsis  1. The use of ellipsis signals the deletion of words in condensing text. In such cases, write three periods with spaces before and after.  Example:  - 'The impacts of geopolitical tensions ... and the shifts in trade dynamics have created a landscape filled with uncertainties.'  2. When using an ellipsis to indicate an incomplete sentence, write three periods with a space only after the last period.  Example:  - 'In recent years, cooperation and adaptability… This helped the economy weather various challenges.'  3. If the text preceding an ellipsis is a complete sentence, a period must be placed before the ellipsis. In such cases, write four periods, with a space after the first and last periods.   Example:  - 'Economies continue to adapt and innovate. … Central banks implement diverse monetary policies to stimulate growth and manage inflationary pressures.'     Avoid beginning or ending a quotation with an ellipsis, unless the source includes one.    7 Source: https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/08/punctuating-around-quotation-marks.html  ",
    "SPECIAL CHARACTERS": "A. Currency symbols and codes  1. Use the currency symbol (₱, $, ¥, €, etc.) when followed by a numerical figure to express a specific monetary value.   Examples:  - ₱100 million - US$14 million - ₱49.62/US$1     Write 'US' before the symbol '$' to distinguish it from other dollars, such as the Canadian dollar (C$) or Singapore dollar (S$).    2. Do not capitalize world currencies.  Examples:  \n Philippine peso \n Philippine Peso  \n US dollar \n US Dollar  \n Japanese yen \n Japanese Yen  \n euro \n Euro3. Use the currency name (peso, dollar, yen, euro, etc.) if it follows numbers expressed in words or used independently.  Examples:  - The proposed budget is three million pesos. - The peso rose.   - The government paid two million US dollars. - The US dollar fell.   4. When a material mentions other pesos, specify 'Philippine peso' to distinguish it from similar currencies, such as 'Mexican peso' or 'Colombian peso.'  Example:   - They analyzed the impact of fluctuations in the Philippine peso and Mexican peso on regional trade dynamics.   \n \n5. Write the terms 'piso' and 'sentimos' in lowercase when referring to denominations of Philippine banknotes and coins.   Examples:  - 1000-piso polymer banknote    - 20-piso New Generation Currency coin - 25-sentimos Flora and Fauna coin  6. Use the International Organization for Standardization's three-letter currency code (PHP, USD, JPY, EUR, etc.) as an abbreviation if not followed or preceded by specific figures.   Examples:  - PHP and EUR are the primary currencies for transactions between the Philippines and Europe.  - USD and JPY-denominated credit instruments are recognized in trades between the United States and Japan.  B. Percent  1. Use the term 'percent' rather than the symbol '%' in the body (main text).   Examples:  - The country's domestic growth reached 7.6 percent in 2022, the highest in 46 years.  - Headline inflation is seen to settle below 4.0 percent by the end of 2023.  2. Use the term 'percentage' when the word is not preceded by any number.  Examples:  - They provided guidance on the acceptable percentage of non-performing loans.  - The percentage of people agreeing to the proposal is small.  3. The term 'percent' (which refers to a portion of a whole) is different from 'percentage point' (which indicates the numerical difference between two percentages).      \n \nExamples:  - A change from 10 percent to 13 percent is an increase of  3.0 percentage points.   - After the tax rate decreased by 2.0 percentage points,  the new rate is 5.0 percent.  4. Use the symbol '%' in tables, except for column or row headings, which should indicate the term 'percent' or 'percentage,' whichever is appropriate. There should be no space between the figure and the percent symbol (e.g., 12.54%).  C. Minus sign  1. Use the minus sign (-) before a number or enclose the number in parentheses to signify a decline.   2. Avoid using parentheses around numbers with a minus sign to prevent double negatives.  Example:  \n The rate of change of unemployment was -2.0 percent. \n The rate of change of unemployment was (2.0 percent). \n The rate of change of unemployment was (-2.0 percent).  3. Similarly, avoid using the minus sign after stating that the variable or unit 'declined,' 'fell,' or 'decreased.'  Example:  \n Consumer confidence in the euro area fell by 27.4 percent. \n Consumer confidence in the euro area fell by -27.4 percent. \n Consumer confidence in the euro area fell by (27.4 percent).      \n",
    "LISTS": "A. Run-in lists  1. For relatively short lists of three or more items, the APA Publication Manual recommends the use of a serial comma, including one before the final item.  Example:  - The bank's security measures include encryption, multi-factor authentication, and regular audits.  2. If items in a list contain commas, use semicolons to separate them.   Example:   - Growth was driven by contributions from agriculture, forestry, and fishing; coconut, including copra; and other agricultural crops.  B. Lettered run-in lists   1. For lists with parallel and complex items, use lowercase letters (enclosed in parentheses) to clearly identify each item.   Example:  - Higher spending was recorded in several subsectors:  (a) food and non-alcoholic beverages, (b) restaurants and hotels, and (c) recreation and culture.  2. Do not add a colon if the introductory phrase for the list is not an independent clause or a complete sentence.  Example:  - The conference covered (a) digital banking innovations,  (b) regulatory compliance updates, and (c) consumer engagement strategies.     For detailed guidance on the proper usage of colons in lists,  refer to Section IV-D (p. 22).\n \nC. Numbered vertical lists   1. Numbers are used to present list items consisting of complete sentences or paragraphs arranged in a series or sequence.   2. The first word after each number is capitalized, and each item ends with a punctuation mark.  Examples:  We addressed three research questions in this study:  1. How do interest rate adjustments influence inflation? 2. How do central banks regulate financial institutions? 3. How do central banks respond to economic crises?  Here is a step-by-step process to calculate the mean:  1. Identify the set of numbers to be computed. 2. Get the sum of the values in the dataset. 3. Count the number of values in the dataset.  4. Divide the sum of the numbers by the total count.  D. Bulleted vertical lists   1. Bullets are used to present list items without implying any specific sequence or order of importance.   2. When the list is made up of complete sentences, each item begins with a capitalized word and ends with a punctuation mark.   Example:  Central banks can utilize social media in many ways:  - Monitoring social media aids in gauging public sentiment about economic conditions. - Posting financial literacy materials through social media reaches stakeholders. - Sharing economic updates through social media prompts real-time discussions. - Engaging with the public through interactive Q&A sessions via social media fosters transparency. - Utilizing social media for advocacy helps shape public perception.  3. In terms of style, the BSP convention is to use solid bullets  (filled circle) for first-level items and hollow bullets (unfilled circle) for second-level items.  \n \nE. Punctuating list items  1. When vertical lists are made up of phrases, the first word of each item should not be capitalized and should not end with a punctuation mark. However, the use of semicolons after each item varies depending on the item's length.   2. Shorter and simpler items typically do not require semicolons.  Example:  The BSP is tasked to perform the following functions:  - liquidity management - currency issue - lender of last resort - financial supervision - management of foreign currency reserves - determination of exchange rate policy - bond issue - banker of the government  3. Longer and more complex items require a semicolon at the end of each item-except for the last one, which ends with a period.  The item preceding the last one is also followed by the conjunction 'and' or 'or.'  Example:  As the Philippines' central monetary authority, the BSP is responsible for:  - maintaining price stability conducive to a balanced and sustainable growth of the economy and employment; - promoting and maintaining monetary stability and the convertibility of the peso; - promoting financial stability; - overseeing the payments and settlements system to promote sound and prudent practices; and - promoting broad and convenient access to high-quality financial services for the interest of the general public.",
    "CITATIONS": "A. General rule  1. An in-text citation is a brief reference within the body that gives credit to the source of information. It typically includes the  last name/s of the author/s, the publication year, and the page number/s.  2. The structure for in-text citations varies depending on the kind of quote (direct, indirect, or block) and writing style. Some of the standard formats are provided throughout this section.  3. For single-author citations, write the author's last name, followed by the publication year.   Example:  - Central banks' decisions to change interest rates are purposeful (Gali, 2008).   - Gali (2008) stated that central banks' decisions to change interest rates are purposeful.   4. For two-author citations, use the conjunction 'and' to join the authors' last names within the sentence and an ampersand (&) when the names are enclosed in parentheses.  Example:  - According to Santos and Mullineux (2010), addressing regulatory overlaps requires stronger coordination efforts among regulatory agencies.   - Addressing regulatory overlaps requires stronger coordination efforts among regulatory agencies (Santos & Mullineux, 2010).    5. For works with three or more authors, list only the first author's last name, followed by 'et al.'   Example:  - There is always a role for judgment in forecasting because special factors and uncertain timing of events have important sporadic effects (Benes et al., 2010).   - Benes et al. (2010) inferred that there is always a role for judgment in forecasting because special factors and uncertain timing of events have important sporadic effects. \n \n6. For multiple cited works, list the references in alphabetical order, separated by semicolons.  Example:  - International remittances may result in recipients' reduced participation in the workforce (Acosta et al., 2007; Pernia, 2008; Rodriguez & Tiongson, 2001).  7. Aside from providing in-text citations, it is essential to include a reference list at the end of the document or in an annex for full attribution of source materials.     For detailed guidance on the proper formatting for references, refer to Section VIII (pp. 39-47).    B. Direct quotation  1. A direct quotation replicates words exactly as they appear from another written work.   2. While paraphrasing is ideal for integrating source materials into the context of your work, direct quotations are recommended when restating a definition, a significant concept, or a memorable phrase.   3. When quoting directly, enclose the text in quotation marks and provide the last name/s of the author/s, the publication year, and the page number/s from where the quote was lifted.  Example:  - 'Increased domestic growth does not always correlate with improved income distribution' (Smith & Jones, 2023, p. 125).  - As stated by Smith and Jones (2023), 'Increased domestic growth does not always correlate with improved income distribution' (p. 125).  - Smith and Jones (2023) argued that 'increased domestic growth does not always correlate with improved income distribution' (p. 125).  4. Use the abbreviation 'p.'  when citing from a single page and 'pp.' for multiple pages, separating the page range with an en dash.    Examples:  - p. 289 - pp. 47-52  \n \n5. For discontinuous pages, use 'pp.' and separate the page numbers with commas.   Examples:  - pp. 25, 120 - pp. 15, 18, 24  6. When the material lacks page numbers (e.g., e-books, webpages), indicate the title of the section or provide the paragraph number ('para. XX') of the quoted text.   Examples:  - Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, 2024, Price stability section - Brion, 2018, para. 4  7. When directly quoting from an audiovisual material (e.g., YouTube video), provide the timestamp indicating the start of the quotation in place of a page number.  Example:  - 'We must remain vigilant against inflationary pressures' (Powell, 2020, 15:35).  - In the words of Powell (2020), 'We must remain vigilant against inflationary pressures' (15:35).  C. Indirect quotation  1. An indirect quotation or paraphrasing involves rewriting the original text in your own words.  Example:  [Original text] 'The implementation of stricter banking     regulations has increased financial stability'     (Espina, 2021, p. 12).  [Paraphrased] Espina (2021) stated that the introduction of     more stringent banking rules has enhanced     financial stability.  2. While indirect quotes do not use quotation marks, proper attribution to the source is still required.      \n \nD. Block quotation   1. A block quotation is a lengthy quotation set off from the main text, typically used for 40 or more words.  2. While block quotations are directly lifted from another work, avoid placing them inside quotation marks.  3. Begin a block quotation on a new line and indent the block by  0.5 inch (1.27 cm) from the left margin.  4. When using a parenthetical citation, place the source, the publication year, and the page number/s (enclosed in parentheses) immediately after the block quotation's final punctuation.  Example:  Analysts are increasingly exploring the impact of digital banking in the Philippines:    Digital banking represents a transformative shift in financial services. It is central to modern banking practices, yet its complex nature poses challenges for comprehensive study. Nevertheless, various research methods have been employed to understand its implications for financial institutions and customers alike. (Canlas & Mañio, 2023, p. 112)  5. When using a narrative citation, introduce the source and the publication year at the beginning of the narrative and place the page number/s (enclosed in parentheses) after the block quotation's final punctuation.  Example:  Canlas and Mañio (2023) noted the importance of studying digital banking in the Philippines:   Digital banking represents a transformative shift in financial services. It is central to modern banking practices, yet its complex nature poses challenges for comprehensive study. Nevertheless, various research methods have been employed to understand its implications for financial institutions and customers alike. (p. 112)     Whether using a parenthetical or narrative citation, avoid placing a period after the closing parenthesis in block quotations.      ",
    "REFERENCES": "A. General rule  1. References are alphabetically arranged based on the first author's last name in each bibliographic entry.   2. If multiple entries were written by the same author or set of authors, arrange them chronologically based on the year of publication.   3. When writing names, spell out the last name, followed by a comma, then the initials with periods.    Examples:  - Alfonso, M. G. - Serrano, J. A. - Sta. Rita, D. A.  4. To join the names of multiple authors in a bibliographic entry,  use an ampersand for two names and commas and an ampersand for three or more names.  Examples:  - Alfonso, M. G. & Serrano, J. A. - Alfonso, M. G., Serrano, J. A., & Sta. Rita, D. A.  5. Titles and subtitles in bibliographic entries are written in sentence case, where only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized.  6. The first line of each bibliographic entry is flush left and justified. Subsequent lines (hanging lines) are indented by 0.5 inch (1.27 cm).  7. For entries with no publication year, write the acronym 'n.d.'  (no date) enclosed in parentheses.  8. Always provide a retrieval date when citing an unarchived source that might change over time. This indicates that the version of the material accessed online may differ from the version referenced by the writer.     While bibliography rules vary across types of materials, the BSP generally follows the APA Publication Manual, 7th edition.     \n \nB. Books and periodicals  1. Book  FORMAT EXAMPLE Author, A. B.

Abbreviations are frequently used in references for books, reports, and other publications.   2. Observe the proper punctuation and combined usage of uppercase and lowercase letters for these abbreviations:  TYPE ABBREVIATION edition ed. revised edition Rev. ed. editor (editors) Ed. (Eds.) no date n.d. page (pages) p. (pp.) volume (volumes) Vol. (Vols.) number No.  H. Footnotes  1. Footnotes are brief explanatory or bibliographic notes at the bottom of a page. These provide additional context without disrupting the flow of the main text.   2. Only footnotes that are complete sentences should end with a period.  3. Footnote callouts are superscript numbers (1,2,3) or symbols (*) placed in the main text to indicate a corresponding footnote at the bottom of the page.  4. Place footnote callouts after punctuation marks (periods, commas, quotation marks, etc.)-except for dashes, colons, and semicolons.   Examples:  - The country maintained its rating from S&P Global at 'BBB.'1  - Higher gains were recorded in three subsectors2: hotels, restaurants, and transport.  5. Use commas to separate two or more footnote callouts placed together. There should be no space before and after the comma.  Example:  - A less-than-favorable outlook on the Philippines' recovery put pressure on the peso.1,2 ",
    "OTHER CONVENTIONS": "A. Organizational names  1. The name of the institution 'Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' should always be spelled out in full at first mention. 'Bangko Sentral,' 'BSP,' or 'Bank' (capitalized) may be used in subsequent references.   2. When referring to the institution as a noun, precede it with the article 'the' to mean 'the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas,'  'the BSP,' or 'the Bank.'  3. When using the name of the institution to modify another noun, state the term without the article 'the' (e.g., BSP departments,  BSP employees).  4. Due to its peculiar history, the English translation of the BSP's full name (Central Bank of the Philippines) or its abbreviation (CBP) is not used as another term for the Bangko Sentral. These are only used to refer to its predecessor before 1993.  5. When identifying a specific regional office or branch,  the convention is to add 'BSP' before stating the unit's name  (e.g., BSP Greater Manila Regional Office).  B. Personal names  1. When stating the names of BSP officials and staff, the standard practice is to include the middle initial (e.g., Juan V. dela Cruz).  2. When mentioning a BSP official multiple times within a single document, write their title and full name at first mention and their title and last name in subsequent references.  Example:  - Director Juan V. dela Cruz discussed the importance of sustainable central banking. Director dela Cruz actively supports initiatives that integrate sustainability into the financial sector.     For detailed guidance on the proper format for titles and name suffixes, refer to Section I-B (pp. 1-2).     \n \nC. Dates  1. The BSP convention is to write the day, followed by the month and year, with no commas in between.  Example:  - 18 January 2014  2. The same order applies when writing partial dates.   Examples:   - 18 January - January 2014  3. For policy issuances, memoranda, and other official documents,  a zero must be added before the days 1 to 9 to prevent possible tampering.  Example:  - 01 January 2014  4. For date ranges, use the midsized dash (-) instead of the preposition 'to.'  Example:  - 10-18 January 2014  5. When listing multiple days within the same month, separate the days with commas and use a comma followed by the conjunction 'and' before the last day.  Example:  - 10, 15, and 18 January 2014     All months should be spelled out in full, whether they are used with a day and year or on their own.9      9 This rule departs from the AP Stylebook, which recommends abbreviating January, February, August, September, October, November, and December when used with a date.   \n \nD. Italicization   1. Titles of books, artistic compositions, reports, and periodicals should be italicized in the body (main text).   Examples:  - The BSP launched the Monetary Policy Report as its flagship publication, replacing the quarterly Inflation Report.  - Our corporate social responsibility initiatives were featured in the anniversary issue of The Central Banker.  2. Non-English words, such as those in Filipino or other languages, should be italicized. This rule also applies to Arabic words used in Islamic finance (e.g., sukuk, takaful).  Exception: The BSP's official name 'Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' and its shortened form 'Bangko Sentral' should not be italicized.  E. Tenses  1. Most BSP publications are written in the past tense since they are usually published months after the reference quarter, semester, or year has ended. However, some reports or sections may be written in the present tense.   2. Use the past tense:  - to report results The economy grew by 3.5 percent in the last quarter, indicating increased investment in key sectors.  - to describe the methodology used The researchers employed regression analysis to examine the relationship between inflation rates and consumer spending patterns.  - to refer to previous research cited in the article Smith (2018) investigated the impact of fiscal policies, including taxation strategies and government expenditure, on economic growth.  - to describe a fact, law, or finding that is no longer considered valid or relevant Early 20th century researchers believed that the Earth was the only planet in our solar system with water on its surface.    \n \n3. Use the present tense:  - to express others' findings that continue to be true The principle of supply and demand has a persistent influence on pricing and resource allocation.  - to refer to the article itself Table 5 presents a comparative analysis of the prevailing development patterns between 2021 and 2022.  - to discuss own findings This study reveals that increased global demand for certain goods is driving up prices in the country.  - to present the conclusion The researchers conclude that supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures continue to impact the global economy, prompting a reassessment of monetary policies.  F. Spelling   1. For BSP publications, it is recommended to use American English rather than the British style.   2. Below are some commonly used British spellings in the BSP and their American counterparts.  BRITISH ENGLISH Instead of writing: AMERICAN ENGLISH Write: towards toward fulfil fulfill analyse analyze labelling labeling labour labor prioritise prioritize cheque check centre center programme program defence defense travelling traveling favour favor colour color  Exception: The British spelling 'storey'-rather than the American spelling 'story'-should be used when referring to levels of buildings (e.g., Five-Storey Building). This prevents confusion with the word 'story,' which means a tale or narrative.  OTHER CONVENTIONS \n \nFor the proper spelling and usage of specific English words,  refer to Webster's New World College Dictionary.    G. Contractions  1. Contractions are shortened words created by combining two words and using an apostrophe to replace the omitted letters.  2. Contractions are usually discouraged in formal writing.   Exception: The use of contractions is acceptable when quoting personal narratives to retain the distinct touch and individuality of the speaker.   Example:  - The Governor said, 'I believe there's never been a better time to invest in the stock market, given the country's economic growth and stability.'  H. Third-person point of view   1. The third-person point of view is a narrative perspective where writers act as outside observers and refrain from using 'we' to refer to themselves.  2. Most BSP publications and technical reports should observe the consistent use of the third-person point of view.   Exception: Speeches, scripts, and similar materials may deviate from this rule. In such cases, writers are encouraged to use the  first-person or second-person perspective to directly engage with the audience.    I. Inanimate objects  1. Avoid using action verbs and attributing human characteristics to inanimate objects or concepts.  2. To prevent ambiguity, use objective language and maintain a professional tone.  Example:  \n Inflation is gradually affecting the household budget. \n Inflation is creeping into the household budget. \n \nJ. Pluralization  1. Pluralization typically involves adding suffixes like '-s' or '-es' to denote that more than one entity is being referenced.   2. While pluralization often follows straightforward rules, some words tend to deviate from the regular patterns that result in grammatical errors, including:  - basis - bases  - forum - forums or fora - formula - formulas (not formulae) - memorandum - memoranda (not memorandums) - criterion - criteria - index - indices - datum - data - appendix - appendices - medium - media - crisis - crises     'Data' is a plural noun and should always be accompanied by a plural verb (e.g., are, show, indicate).    K. Concise language  1. Clarity and conciseness are essential in effective writing. Avoiding unnecessary words not only improves readability but also enhances the impact of the message.  2. Below are examples of common redundant phrases and their streamlined alternatives:  - the question as to whether - whether - there is no doubt - no doubt - at this point in time - now - in the event that - if - due to the fact that - because - in order to - to - has the ability to - can - in the near future - soon - with regard to - regarding - on a daily basis - daily - at the present time - currently - by means of - by - despite the fact that - although - in the process of - during \n \nL. Inclusive language  1. Inclusive or bias-free language fosters equality and respect by avoiding expressions that could exclude, marginalize, or offend individuals based on their culture, gender, social status, or other diverse characteristics.   2. The APA Publication Manual endorses the use of inclusive language in writing.10   3. Below are some examples of bias-free terms and their former counterparts:  ACCEPTED TERMS FORMER TERMS they/them/their he/him/his; she/her/hers humanity; people mankind layperson layman chairperson; chair chairman spokesperson spokesman workforce manpower older adults elderly; senior citizens; old people underrepresented groups minorities person with disability disabled person synthetic; artificial man-made people with low incomes the poor  people who are receiving social security benefits social security beneficiaries person who is seeking employment;  job seeker unemployed person; jobless   10 Source: APA Publication Manual, 7th edition",
    "COMMON GRAMMATICAL ERRORS": "A. Toward vs. towards  While most dictionaries treat 'towards' as just a variation of 'toward,' the AP Stylebook is quite emphatic that 'toward' is the correct word. It argues that none of the words ending with the suffix 'ward' end with an 's.'  B. That vs. which  1. 'That' and 'which' (also who and whom) are relative pronouns used to introduce a subordinate clause.  2. 'That' is used for restrictive clauses essential to the meaning of the sentence. It should not be preceded by a comma.  Example:  - The economic model that predicts market fluctuations is widely used by financial analysts.  3. 'Which' is used for nonrestrictive clauses that provide additional information but are not essential to the meaning of the sentence. Nonrestrictive clauses should be set off by commas.  Example:  - The stock market, which has shown resilience amid global uncertainties, continues to attract investors.  C. Compared to vs. compared with  1. 'Compared to' is used to note a similarity between two items without further elaboration. It is also used to note how one item is similar to another item from a different category.  Example:  - The Philippine economy's resilience can be compared to a sturdy ship navigating turbulent waters.  2. 'Compared with' is used when juxtaposing two items, usually belonging to similar categories, for the purpose of measuring one against the other.   Example:  - Consumer spending increased by 8.6 percent in 2023, compared with 1.4 percent in 2022. \n \nD. Comprise vs. compose vs. consist  1. 'Comprise' (verb) means 'to include or contain.' Use it in the active voice, immediately followed by the direct object.  Example:  - The Philippines comprises over 7,600 islands  'Comprise' may also be used in sentences where the subject is a part of what makes up the whole.  Example:  - Oil and coal comprise 70 percent of the nation's exports.  2. 'Compose' (verb) means 'to constitute a part of' or 'to form the basis of.' It is used to describe the individual components that collectively create something larger.  Examples:  - Eight slices compose the pie.  - The pie is composed of eight slices.  3. 'Consist' (verb) means 'to be made up of specific components.'  It is always followed by the preposition 'of.'  Example:  - The whole group consists of economists.  E. Per vs. as per  1. 'Per' is a preposition used in place of 'for each.' It is commonly seen in phrases expressing rates, ratios, and averages.  Example:  - The country had been exporting 400 metric tons of rice  per annum (for each year) since 2014.  2. 'As per' refers to any source from which information is being derived and is used in place of 'according to.' It is considered legalistic, often used to discuss guidelines or specific instructions.  Example:   - As per the regulatory guidelines, banks must maintain sufficient liquidity buffers. \n \nF. Regard vs. regards  1. Never place an 's' after the word 'regard' when used in phrases such as 'with regard to' or 'in regard to.'    Examples:  - Each industry seems to have its particular rules with regard to payment terms.  - Important changes are being made in regard to security.  2. The letter 's' only applies to the phrase 'as regards.'    Example:  - We require further consideration as regards your suggestion.  G. Regardless  1. 'Regardless' (adverb) means 'despite the prevailing circumstances.'   2. It should never be confused with 'irregardless' (a blend of 'irrespective' and 'regardless'), which is not considered a valid word.   Example:  \n The bank maintained competitive loan terms regardless of interest rate changes.  \n The bank maintained competitive loan terms irregardless of interest rate changes.  H. Imply vs. infer  1. 'Imply' (verb) means 'to suggest something indirectly.'   Example:   - The bank's decision to hold interest rates steady implies confidence in the growth trajectory.  2. 'Infer' (verb) means 'to deduce or conclude something from evidence or reasoning.'  Example:  - Economists inferred from the latest report that consumer spending was robust.  \n \nI. In vs. on vs. at  1. Use 'in' to indicate a specific year, quarter, month, or season and a general timeframe.  Examples:  - The new building was inaugurated in 2014. - The study was conducted in Q1 2022. - We aim to finalize the deal in January. - Farmers typically harvest their crops in the summer. - The project will be completed in two weeks.  2. Use 'on' to indicate a day of the week or a complete date.  Examples:  - The event is scheduled on Friday. - The report is due on 18 January 2024.  3. Use 'at' to indicate a specific point in time.   Example:  - The meeting starts at 9:00 a.m.  4. Avoid alternating between 'in' and 'on' for partial dates. Use 'on' strictly to indicate a complete set of day, month, and year or a combination of day and month.   Examples:  - The report was submitted on 25 July 2022. - The report was submitted on 25 July. - The report was submitted in July 2022. - The report was submitted in July.  5. When indicating periods of the day, use 'in' for morning and afternoon and 'at' for noon, night, and midnight.  6. Refrain from using 'last' to indicate dates. If unavoidable,  restrict its use for standalone months (e.g., last January) and days  (e.g., last Wednesday).     For detailed guidance on the proper formatting for dates,  refer to Section IX-C (p. 49).    \n \nJ. First, second, third  1. 'First,' 'second,' and 'third' are enumerative transitions used to list lengthy points or ideas (usually paragraphs) in a sequence.   2. Contemporary writing trends increasingly favor these simpler forms than the traditional 'firstly,' 'secondly,' and 'thirdly.'  K. Ago vs. before/previous/preceding  1. These terms are often used interchangeably when comparing indicators for a certain period with those from the past. It can be justified when discussing indicators for the current year. For instance, in 2024, 'year ago' refers to indicators from 2023.  2. If the current year is 2024, 'year ago' refers only to 2023, not 2022 or 2021. Thus, to compare figures from years earlier than 2023,  it is better to use terms like 'the year before,' 'the previous year,' 'the prior year,' or 'the preceding year.'  3. 'Last year' is the same as 'year ago,' as both are often used in relation to the present time. If the report is being published in 2024, 'last year' could only be interpreted to mean 2023.  Recommended:  - The surplus rose by half in 2024 from 2023.  - The surplus rose by half in 2024 from the year before.  - The surplus rose by half in 2024 from the previous year. - The surplus rose by half in 2024 from the preceding year. - The surplus rose by half in 2024 from the prior year.   Not recommended:  - The surplus rose by half in 2024 from a year ago.  - The surplus rose by half in 2024 from last year.   L. Alternate vs. alternative   1. When used as adjectives, 'alternate' refers to every other one in a series, while 'alternative' denotes one of two or more possibilities.   Examples:  - The company opted for an alternate payment schedule, paying the bank every other month.   - The company explored alternative investment strategies to diversify its portfolio. \n \n2. When used as nouns, an 'alternate' may stand as a substitute, while an 'alternative' presents another choice apart from the initial option.  Examples:  - He served as an alternate on the advisory committee, attending meetings on behalf of the Governor.  - Investors sought alternatives to traditional markets during the economic downturn.  M. Continuously vs. continually  1. 'Continuously' describes an action that happens without ceasing.     Example:  \n The clock continuously ticked until the battery ran out. \n The clock continually ticked until the battery ran out.  2. 'Continually' describes an action that recurs frequently.  Example:  \n The BSP continually refines its regulatory policies. \n The BSP continuously refines its regulatory policies.  N. Forecast vs. outlook  1. While both terms involve an element of projection about what is likely to happen in the future, they have different meanings and usage.   2. 'Forecast' refers to a prediction or estimation of future conditions based on statistical data and analysis.  Example:  - The latest forecast shows a slightly lower path, with baseline inflation seen to settle at an average of 3.6 percent for 2024.  3. 'Outlook' refers to a broader perspective or expectation of future conditions, typically based on expert judgment and informed by forecasts.  Example:  - The risks to the inflation outlook continue leaning toward the upside in view of higher transport charges and increased electricity rates. \n \nO. Result in  1. 'Result' (verb) is used to indicate a cause-and-effect relationship.   2. The word is always paired with the preposition 'in' and is never used with the preposition 'to.'  Examples:  - They implemented restructuring methods in their operations, resulting in increased profitability.  - The failure to address climate change may result in environmental consequences.  P. Farther vs. further  1. Use 'farther' to indicate physical distance or literal advancement  in space.  Example:  - The Monetary Board holds meetings in the conference room farther down the hall.  2. Use 'further' to indicate metaphorical distance or abstract advancement.  Example:  - The new policy further strengthened the use of digital payments in the country.  Q. Advance vs. advanced  1. 'Advance' (adjective) means 'provided or carried out in advance or prior to an event.'  Example:  \n Their office will be sending an advance copy of the speech. \n Their office will be sending an advanced copy of the speech.  2. 'Advanced' (adjective) means 'far on' or 'ahead.'  Example:  \n Writing technical reports requires advanced knowledge. \n Writing technical reports requires advance knowledge. \n \nR. Partly vs. partially   1. 'Partly' (adverb) means 'to some extent or not completely.'  It conveys the idea of a part as distinct from the whole.  Example:  - The improved profitability of the bank was partly a result of  cost-cutting measures.  2. 'Partially' (adverb) means 'only in part.' It is used to indicate the extent or degree to which something is done, affected, or completed.  Example:  - They were partially able to accomplish the report.  S. Damage vs. damages   1. 'Damage' means 'loss or injury to a person or property.' It is an uncountable singular noun and has no plural form.   Example:   - Typhoon Egay caused irreparable damage to crops.  2. 'Damages' refers to money claimed by, or ordered to be paid to, a person as compensation for loss or injury. It is an uncountable plural noun and has no singular form.  Example:  - He was awarded US$2.5 million in damages for the injuries sustained in the workplace accident.  T. Compliance with  1. 'Compliance' (noun) refers to the act of conforming to or following a set of regulations.  2. The word is always paired with the preposition 'with' and is never used with the preposition 'to.'  Examples:  - Compliance with the new regulations is mandatory for all businesses.  - The new software was developed in compliance with industry standards. \n \nU. And/or  1. 'And/or' is a compound conjunction used to express that either one of the options or both of them are possible.  Example:  - Customers may request a repayment plan and/or a loan extension to manage their financial obligations.  2. The APA Publication Manual suggests using 'and/or' sparingly. Rephrasing the sentence with the phrase 'or both' might offer a more precise alternative.   Example:   - Customers may request a repayment plan, a loan extension, or both to manage their financial obligations.     A slash (/) is used to connect compound conjunctions.  There should be no space on either side of the slash.     V. Either/or vs. neither/nor  1. 'Either/or' and 'neither/nor' are correlative conjunctions used to connect mutually exclusive or negated elements.  2. 'Either/or' indicates that one option or the other is true, possible,  or applicable.  Example:  - Either the President or the Governor can represent the country in the ASEAN forum.   3. 'Neither/nor' indicates that neither of the options (not one) is true, possible, or applicable.  Example:   - Neither the President nor the Governor confirmed their attendance to the upcoming ASEAN forum.       \n \nW. Leverage  1. 'Leverage' (verb) means 'to utilize something to maximum advantage.'   2. The word should not be used with a preposition unless it is functioning as an infinitive (e.g., to leverage) or a noun.  Example:  \n We leverage new technologies to strengthen our risk surveillance tools.  \n We leverage on new technologies to strengthen our risk surveillance tools.  X. Fellow/colleague  1. 'Fellow' (adjective) is used to refer to someone who has the same job as you.   2. Similarly, 'colleague' (noun) pertains to a person you work with.   3. Do not use both words together, as it is redundant.   Example:  \n The Governor attended the forum with his fellow BSP employees. \n The Governor attended the forum with his BSP colleagues. \n The Governor attended the forum with his fellow colleagues.  Y. Unit concerned vs. concerned unit  1. The phrase 'unit concerned' refers to the unit directly involved in or responsible for a specific matter.  Example:   - The unit concerned with consumer protection will issue an advisory to prevent scamming incidents.  2. The phrase 'concerned unit' refers to the unit worried or interested in a specific matter, often due to potential implications or consequences.   Example:  - Staff from the concerned unit reached out to the affected consumers.   ",
    "LATIN ABBREVIATIONS": "Although Latin is no longer the international language of scholars, many of its terms remain widely used in academic writing today. This section briefly discusses these terms and their proper usage.11  A. etc.        1. The abbreviation 'etc.' stands for 'et cetera,' which translates literally as 'and others' or 'and the rest.' A more helpful translation, especially when reading aloud, is 'and so on.'  2. Avoid adding the conjunction 'and' in a list ending in 'etc.,' as it already indicates that more elements are being left out.  Example:  \n Banking services, such as loans, mortgages, credit cards, etc., must adhere to regulatory guidelines.  \n Banking services, such as loans, mortgages, credit cards, and, etc., must adhere to regulatory guidelines. B. e.g.       1. The abbreviation 'e.g.' stands for 'exempli gratia,' which can be expressed as 'for example.' It is used to illustrate or clarify the preceding idea by providing an instance or a set of instances.   2. The BSP convention is to always enclose 'e.g.' in parentheses.  It should also always be followed by a comma.   3. Avoid adding the conjunction 'and' in a list beginning with 'e.g.' Similarly, avoid using 'etc.' at the end of a list following 'e.g.,' as it already indicates that there are more elements than those enumerated.  Example:  \n Banking services (e.g., loans, mortgages, credit cards) must adhere to regulatory guidelines.  \n Banking services (e.g., loans, mortgages, and credit cards) must adhere to regulatory guidelines.  \n Banking services (e.g., loans, mortgages, credit cards, etc.) must adhere to regulatory guidelines.   11 Source: https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/latin-terms-and-abbreviations/   \n \nC. i.e.       1. The abbreviation 'i.e.' stands for 'id est,' which translates literally as 'that is.' It is used to clarify the preceding idea by restating it more simply or in different terms.   2. The BSP convention is to always enclose 'i.e.' in parentheses.  It should also always be followed by a comma.   Example:   - The BSP directed all banks to accept the national ID  (i.e., Philippine identification card) as the sole proof of identity for individuals who wish to open an account.  D. et al.       1. The abbreviation 'et al.' stands for 'et alia,' which means 'and other people.' It is generally used to cite books, articles, or other publications with three or more authors to save space.   2. The BSP convention is to write the first author's last name, followed by the abbreviation 'et al.'   3. There should be a space between 'et' and 'al,' and only the latter should be followed by a period.  Example:   \n Veloro et al. (2023) \n Veloro, Finianos, Kraft, Lao, and Raquid (2023)  E. Ibid.       1. The abbreviation 'Ibid.' stands for 'ibidem,' which means 'in the same place.' It is used in footnotes when citing a similar source multiple times.   2. If the cited source is located on a different page, use 'Ibid.,' followed by a comma and the page number/s from the document.

The main editorial elements of figures and tables-aside from statistics and graphs-are item numbers, titles, captions  (or axis descriptions), periods covered, data sources, and endnotes.  2. BSP publications should observe the preferred style below:  TYPE FORMAT Figure or table number Montserrat, 10 pts. Sentence case; center Black font color Figure or table title Montserrat, 11 pts., boldface Title case; center Dark blue font color  NOTE: Avoid using acronyms or abbreviations.  Caption Montserrat, 10 pts. Lowercase; center Black font color  NOTE: Captions usually contain y- and x-axis titles and the numerical denomination of figures (e.g., in billion pesos). Multiple captions are separated by semicolons. Period covered Montserrat, 10 pts. Title case; center Black font color  NOTE: All months should be spelled out in full, including January, February, etc. Source Montserrat, 8 pts. Title case; aligned left Black font color  NOTE: Indicate the label 'Source,' followed by a colon. Avoid using acronyms or abbreviations. Endnote Montserrat, 8 pts. Sentence case for sentences; aligned left Lowercase for data descriptions (e.g., preliminary) Black font color  NOTE: Do not indicate the label 'Endnote/s.'       \n \nB. Data symbols  1. Using consistent symbols helps effectively convey data, especially in a series of statistics.  2. For uniformity, follow the symbol guide below12:  SYMBOL SYMBOL DESCRIPTION DATA DESCRIPTION - dash not available 0 zero value equal to zero . 1 dot rounds off to zero .. 2 dots no transactions/no quote/ no issue … 3 dots blank .... 4 dots not computed -- 2 dashes undefined or indeterminate growth rate K% percent in thousands applicable units are used for extremely large growth rates M% percent in millions - B% percent in billions - T% percent in trillions -  blank no updates    12 This symbol guide is implemented by the Department of Economic Statistics.                      FIGURES AND TABLES \n \nC. Data sources  1. BSP publications may cite either the name of the source organization or the source of basic data, whichever is applicable.  2. 'Source' is used to cite the primary organization, institution, publication, or agency that provided the data. Use semicolons to separate multiple sources.   Examples:   - Source: Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas  - Sources: Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas; World Bank  3. 'Source of basic data' is used to cite the primary source from which the data was derived. It indicates the specific dataset, survey, research study, or other fundamental source that generated the data. Always include the publication year, enclosed in parentheses.  Example:  - Source of basic data: Labor Force Survey (2023)  D. ‘Percent change' label  1. Tables in BSP publications usually have a column for the amount of change over a period of time. This column is often labeled 'percent growth.'   2. For greater accuracy, replace the label with 'percent change' to account for the values that decreased during the period covered.   3. For the body (main text), avoid using the common but logically complicated term 'negative growth,' which implies a  'positive decline.'",
    "DOCUMENT SPECIFICATIONS": "A. General format  1. BSP publications are typically formatted in A4 (8.3 x 11.7 inches) paper, with margins set to 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) on all sides.  2. The standard text alignment is justified. However, headings and subheadings may be aligned either left or center, depending on the layout.   3. Maintain single spacing within paragraphs and double spacing between paragraphs.  B. Text wrapping  1. Text wrapping pertains to the way text interacts with tables, figures, graphics, or other elements in a document.   2. The BSP convention is to align elements with the baseline of the adjacent text (in line with the text) to maintain a visually cohesive presentation.  3. Avoid placing elements in front or behind the text, especially for collaborative working documents. Different versions of word processing software may misinterpret the setting, leading to unexpected shifts in the layout.  C. Pagination  1. In document terms, a 'widow' is a single line of text that appears at the end of a page, while an 'orphan' is a single line of text that appears at the beginning of a new page.   2. Both widows and orphans are pagination issues that should be avoided to ensure a polished presentation.   3. Adjustments can be made by tweaking the paragraph setting through the following steps:  a. Select the paragraph that has a widow or orphan text. b. Expand the 'Line and paragraph spacing' dialog box from the ribbon. c. Access the 'Line spacing' options. d. Navigate to the 'Line and page breaks' tab. e. Under the 'Pagination' section, choose 'keep lines together.'    \n \n4. Another way to avoid widows/orphans and even disjoined texts  is by using 'Shift + Enter' to force a line break without starting a new paragraph.  Example:  \n The financial account registered net inflows of US$12.6 billion, higher than in 2021.  \n The financial account registered net inflows of US$12.6 billion, higher than in 2021.  D. Multi-level formatting  1. Multi-level formatting is used to organize topics according to levels of importance. It typically helps structure long documents with multiple subtopics.  2. BSP publications use alphanumeric outlines with the following order of characters:  a. Roman numerals b. uppercase letters c. Arabic numerals d. lowercase letters or solid bullets13  3. Use different indentation levels to provide more emphasis.   Example:   I.  [Main point]         A.  [Subpoint]              1.  [Sub-subpoint]                      a.  [Illustration]                      b.  [Illustration]              2. [Sub-subpoint]         B.  [Subpoint]              1.  [Sub-subpoint]                      -  [Illustration]                      -  [Illustration]              2. [Sub-subpoint]   II.  [Main point]   13 Bullets apply to items with no specific order.     \n \nE. Typographic hierarchy  1. Typographic hierarchy refers to the systematic arrangement and presentation of text to create a visual structure within a document. It involves using varying font attributes, including typeface, size, emphasis style, and color.   2. BSP publications should observe the typographic hierarchy below:   TYPE FORMAT Main point Montserrat, 18 pts., boldface Sentence case; aligned left or center Dark blue font color Subpoint Montserrat, 16 pts., boldface Sentence case; aligned left or center Light blue font color Sub-subpoint Montserrat, 14 pts., boldface Sentence case; aligned left Black font color Body Montserrat, 11 pts. Sentence case; justified block Black font color Pull quote Montserrat, 11 pts., italics Sentence case; aligned left Dark blue font color Footnote Montserrat, 8 pts. Sentence case; justified Black font color Footnote callout Montserrat, 11 pts. Superscripted Black font color     For detailed guidance on visual formatting, refer to the BSP's Brand Guidelines (2021), accessible through weKnow.",
    "WRITING LETTERS": "Aside from publications, the BSP also issues letters to external stakeholders. Implementing a standardized format for letters enhances professionalism and reinforces brand identity. This section briefly discusses the components of a letter and the conventions adopted by the central bank.  A. Heading  1. Use the BSP letterhead featuring the logo, the complete organization name 'Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas,' and the dynamic dots branding.   2. Write the name of the sending department or office below the letterhead in uppercase and in boldface.  B. Date  1. The first line after the heading contains the date, formatted as  'DD Month YYYY' and aligned right.  2. Write all the months in full and add a zero before the days 1 to 9 to prevent possible tampering.  C. Recipient details  1. The second line contains the recipient's title and full name, written in uppercase, boldface, and aligned left.   2. The third and fourth lines contain the recipient's designation and organization, both written in title case and aligned left.  3. The succeeding lines contain the address, which may include the room/building number, building name, street, city, and zip code, written in title case and aligned left. Avoid placing commas at the end of each address line.  D. Attention line  1. Some letters include an attention line to ensure that they reach  the intended recipients.   2. The BSP convention is to separate this line from the address block and indent it by 0.5 inch (1.27 cm).  3. Capitalize 'Attention:' or 'Through:' (with colons), followed by the name of the person who can facilitate delivery to the intended recipient. The name should be written in title case and in boldface. If applicable, include the designation on the next line. \n \nE. Subject line  1. The BSP convention is to separate the subject line from the body. It is usually placed below the attention line, indented by 0.5 inch (1.27 cm).  2. Capitalize 'Subject:' (with colon), followed by the actual subject in title case and in boldface.   3. As the subject should summarize the letter's purpose, ensure that it is direct and concise.  F. Salutation  1. A salutation is a short greeting that establishes the tone for the letter's content.  2. The common format for formal communications is 'Dear [Title] [Last name],' followed by a colon.  G. Body  1. The body includes an introduction, the main content, and a conclusion.   2. Maintain a professional tone throughout the body by using respectful language and avoiding slang or overly casual expressions.  3. The standard text alignment for the body is justified. However, the first line of each paragraph should be indented by 0.5 inch (1.27 cm).   H. Closing  1. The closing or the sign-off is a polite statement that precedes the sender's signature.   2. Common closings in formal communications include 'Sincerely,' 'Regards,' and 'Very truly yours' (capitalized and followed by  a comma).  I. Signature   1. The signature should be placed above the sender's full name, written in uppercase and in boldface.  2. If applicable, include the designation of the sender on the next line.",
    "FILIPINO WRITING": "While most BSP publications are written in English, derivative communication materials are usually translated into Filipino. This section provides general guidelines for Filipino writing to address common mistakes.  A. Filipino vs. Pilipino  1. The terms 'Filipino' and 'Pilipino' are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings and applications.  2. The table below outlines the appropriate contexts for using these terms in both English and Filipino writing:14  TYPE ENGLISH WRITING FILIPINO WRITING National language Filipino Filipino Citizen Filipino Pilipino Culture Filipino Pilipino Nation Filipino Pilipino  3. While 'Filipino' was officially designated as the national language only after the 1987 Constitution, the BSP convention is to refer  to the national language as 'Filipino' even in materials created before 1987.  Example:   - The Pilipino Series coins were released in 1968, featuring the profiles of Filipino heroes and legends inscribed in Filipino.  B. Ng  1. Ng is the Filipino counterpart of the preposition 'of.' It answers the question 'what' (ano).  Examples:  - Ang halaga ng peso ay tumaas. (The value of the peso increased.)  2. Ng is also used to indicate possession.  - Ang bagong batas ng gobyerno ay ipinatupad na. (The new law of the government was implemented.)   14 Source: Kilusan ng Wikang Pilipino  \n \nC. Nang  1. Nang answers the questions 'how' (paano), 'how much' (gaano), and 'why' (bakit).  Examples:  - Ang halaga ng peso ay tumaas nang biglaan.  (The value of the peso increased suddenly.)  - Naghintay sila nang limang taon bago naipasa ang batas. (They waited for five years before the law was passed.)  - Pumunta sila sa bangko nang makapagdeposito. (They went to the bank to make a deposit.)  2. Nang is also used in place of 'na ng' to emphasize an action, usually when the verb is repeated. However, it differs from na'ng, which is the contraction of 'na ang.'   Example:  - Humakot nang (na ng) humakot ng parangal ang BSP.  3. In some cases, nang serves as the Filipino counterpart of the conjunction 'when' and is used interchangeably with noong.  Example:  - Nasa trabaho ako nang (noong) marinig ko ang balita. (I was at work when I heard the news.)  D. Rito vs. dito  1. Use rito, rin, roon, and raw when the preceding word ends in a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) or a semi-vowel (w, y).  Examples:  \n Magsasama-sama rito ang mga opisyal. \n Magsasama-sama dito ang mga opisyal.  \n Magbibigay raw sila ng parangal. \n Magbibigay daw sila ng parangal.  Exception: Use daw and din when the preceding word ends in -ra, -re, -ri, -ro, -ru, and -raw.    \n \nExamples:  \n Nagparehistro din siya upang makaboto. \n Nagparehistro rin siya upang makaboto.  \n Araw-araw daw siyang pumipila rito. \n Araw-araw raw siyang pumipila rito.  2. Use dito, din, doon, and daw when the preceding word ends in a consonant.  Example:  \n Magkakaroon daw ng programa para sa kabataan. \n Magkakaroon raw ng programa para sa kabataan.  3. Always use dito and doon when beginning a sentence.  Example:  \n Dito magsisimula ang parada. \n Rito magsisimula ang parada.  E. Sina vs. sila  1. Use sina when stating the personal names of the subjects in a sentence.  2. Use sila when referring to a group of people who are not specifically named or when they are already known or implied.  Examples:   - Sina Juan at Maria ang mangunguna sa proyekto.  - Sila ang magtatalaga ng mga gagawin ng bawat miyembro.   F. Nina vs. nila  1. Use nina before personal names to indicate ownership by two or more persons.  2. Use nila to indicate ownership by a group of people who are not specifically named or when they are already known or implied.  Example:  - Malapit sa bangko ang bahay nina Juan at Maria. - Madaling puntahan ang bahay nila.    \n \nG. Adverbial phrases  1. A common mistake in Filipino writing is the tendency to combine two words into one.   2. Remember that the adverbial phrases 'pa rin,' 'na rin,' 'pa lang,' and 'na lang' should always be written separately.   Example:  \n Patuloy pa rin ang dedikasyon ng BSP sa paglilingkod- para sa bawat Pilipino.  \n Patuloy parin ang dedikasyon ng BSP sa paglilingkod-para sa bawat Pilipino.  H. Pluralization  1. The general rule for pluralizing nouns in Filipino writing is to add the marker 'mga' before the term (e.g., mga empleyado).   2. A common mistake in translated materials is the tendency to append 'mga' to English terms already in plural form, resulting in double pluralization.  3. Remember to maintain the singular form of English terms before adding the Filipino plural marker 'mga.'  Example:  \n Karaniwang nagpapalit ng disenyo ng pera kada sampung taon ang mga central bank.  \n Karaniwang nagpapalit ng disenyo ng pera kada sampung taon ang mga central banks.",
